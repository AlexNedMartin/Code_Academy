#Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

#In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

#Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:
  #Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
  #Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
  #Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
